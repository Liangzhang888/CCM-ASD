## Abstract 
Recent advances in deep learning have shown substantial potential for improving the early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, most existing approaches primarily rely on correlation-based functional connectivity, which captures spatial dependencies among regions of interest (ROIs) but often neglects the temporal causal interactions that are critical in many neurological conditions. Although Granger causality (GC) partially accounts for temporal dynamics, it fails to fully characterize the historical, context-dependent neural interactions implicated in ASD, thereby limiting diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, effectively integrating such latent interactions with raw temporal signals and leveraging them to enhance model performance remain challenging. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Conditional Causal Model for ASD diagnosis (CCM-ASD). The proposed framework integrates three key components: (1) an Adaptive Potential Relationship Construction (APRC) module that employs nonlinear modeling to capture potential inter-ROI relationships associated with ASD; (2) a Conditional Causal Penalty (CCP), derived from the Conditional Granger Causality Index, to guide model optimization; and (3) a Dual-Path Coupled Learning (DPCL) strategy that enables joint learning of direct and potential causal representations for robust diagnostic inference. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed model, we conducted experiments on two subsets of the ABIDE dataset. The results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average improvements of 2.49%, 5.00%, and 5.41% over the second-best method in AUROC, accuracy, and F1-score on the Group 1 dataset, respectively, and corresponding improvements of 1.12%, 1.25%, and 0.55% on the Group 2 dataset. Additional analyses further identify key ASD-related brain regions and functional connections, providing enhanced neuroscientific interpretability.

The codes will be coming soon after our paper be accepted.
